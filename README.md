# K2 Foundation
Blackjack game written from scratch in python, the notebooks for the other topics came with data. The codeblocks were written by me, unless specifically indicated in the notebook.

## To Run
* blackjack.py - This can be launched and run in a terminal window using python3. Game plays per Vegas rules:
1. Player sees own draw and dealer's face-up card.
2. Player chooses to hit or hold.
3. If player busts, game ends.
4. If player gets 21, dealer has a chance to tie.
5. Dealer draws until showing at least 17, busts, or beats player's score.
6. Ties are called a push.

* us_births/births.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook with some very basic data exploration. Launch in a command line with:
`$ jupyter notebook births.ipynb`

* gun_deaths/deaths.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook with additional data exploration. Launch in a command line with:
`$ jupyter notebook deaths.ipynb`

* titanic/titanic.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook with more data exploration. Launch in a command line with:
`$ jupyter notebook titanic.ipynb`
